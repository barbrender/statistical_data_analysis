## Which plan is a better?

### Description
This project aims to help the commercial department of Megaline, a telecom operator, to determine which of their two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, generates more revenue. By analyzing the behavior of a sample of 500 clients who used the plans in 2018, we can provide insights on the revenue generated by each plan and help the company to adjust their advertising budget.

### Project goal:
Finding which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

### Methodology
We analyzed the behavior of clients using the Surf and Ultimate plans to determine which one generated more revenue. To do this, we calculated the monthly revenue for each client based on their plan usage and the plan's pricing. We also compared the average monthly revenue generated by the Surf and Ultimate plans using a t-test. Additionally, we looked at the behavior of users who exceeded their plan limits to see which plan was more profitable in that regard. Lastly, we analyzed the revenue distribution between users in different locations.
