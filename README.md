## Which plan is a better?

### Overview
This project aims to help the commercial department of Megaline, a telecom operator, to determine which of their two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, generates more revenue. By analyzing the behavior of a sample of 500 clients who used the plans in 2018, we can provide insights on the revenue generated by each plan and help the company to adjust their advertising budget.

### Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes information about the clients, their location, which plan they used, and the number of calls and text messages they made in 2018. The dataset was provided by Megaline and consists of 500 records.

### Methodology
We analyzed the behavior of clients using the Surf and Ultimate plans to determine which one generated more revenue. To do this, we calculated the monthly revenue for each client based on their plan usage and the plan's pricing. We also compared the average monthly revenue generated by the Surf and Ultimate plans using a t-test. Additionally, we looked at the behavior of users who exceeded their plan limits to see which plan was more profitable in that regard. Lastly, we analyzed the revenue distribution between users in different locations.

### Results
Our analysis showed that the Ultimate plan has a higher base price and generates more revenue per user, but more users tend to exceed their plan limits and pay additional fees on the Surf plan. Therefore, in terms of overall revenue, the Surf plan is more profitable for the company.

We also found that users tend to prefer the cheaper Surf plan, but in the end, they end up paying more due to exceeding their plan limits. We recommend that Megaline educate their customers on the benefits of the Ultimate plan and consider offering incentives for users to switch plans.

Moreover, we discovered that around 25-50 percent of Surf users exceed their plan limits and pay extra money, while only 5 percent of Ultimate users do the same. This suggests that Megaline should focus on monitoring Surf users' behavior to ensure they are not paying more than they need to.

Lastly, we observed that the revenue distribution between users in NY-NJ is different from other cities, suggesting that Megaline should consider tailoring their advertising strategies for this specific location.

### Conclusion
Based on our analysis, we recommend that Megaline focus their advertising budget on promoting the Surf plan, as it generates more revenue for the company. However, they should also consider educating their customers on the benefits of the Ultimate plan and offering incentives for users to switch plans. They should also monitor Surf users' behavior to ensure they are not paying more than they need to and consider tailoring their advertising strategies for users in the NY-NJ area.
